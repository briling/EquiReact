# Data curation scripts

* [`cyclo-atom-mapping`](cyclo-atom-mapping): atom mapping of reactants and product xyz files of the Cyclo-23-TS dataset using the TS xyz 
* [`cyclo-smiles-mapping`](cyclo-smiles-mapping): indices of the 4 reactions of Cyclo-23-TS where SMILES don't match the xyz
* [`gdb-smiles-mapping`](gdb-smiles-mapping): xyzâ€“SMILES mapping scripts for the GDB7-22-TS and list of "bad" reactions indices 
* [`rxnmapper`](rxnmapper): RXNMapper wrapper tp atom map the datasets
* [`weights-and-biases`](weights-and-biases): scripts to fix the W&B runs summaries (for older 3DReact versions / failed runs / etc)
