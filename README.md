# #TODO (again)

## Cyclo
1. Opt params for each mode
    1. Energy: have tried/submitted variations of dropout, nconv, ns, nv, ngauss, radius / max neighbors, sum mode(node/edge/both), combine mode (diff/sum/mean)
   2. Graph: have submitted with basic params, need to opt params and implement different modes (mean/sum but also maybe an MLP/nonlinear version)
   3. Atom mapping as a third option: not yet submitted with params, nor optimised

## GDB
- Have not been able to get SMILES to pass assert yet
